react component is nothing but the javascript function which returns JSX
component compositition is nothing but the component inside component
u can inject any javascript code inside {}
jsx santize data before rendering (malicious javascript)
props is nothing but passing arguments to function
config driven UI
never use index as key
react makes coding  experience fast
mutiple export defined as name export
whenever state variable updates react re render the component
reconcilation algoritthm is react fiber
virtual dom is represntation of actual dom nothing but objext
diff algo finds out two virtsual dom
react is fast because react is doing efficient dom manupulation react fiber architecture git
monolith
micro service architecture separation of concerns singke resoponsibilty principle diff stack diff services all services are on diff project or diff url

const data = await fetch()
const data1 =  await data.json()
data.cards[5].card.card.gridElements.infoWithStyle.restaurants
shimmer UI fake UI
conditional rendering
state react whenever state variable updates react re render component
if no dependecny array use effect will be called on every render
for empty dependency array useeffect will be called on only initial render
if we put anything inside dependency array it will be called when dependency changes
use state always in function component
declare on top and never use it inside if else/for loop/function
everything is component in react
rafce
error hook:userRouterError
function starting with use is hook
childernRoute whenever there is change in path outlet will be filled according to children.outlet is nothing but the component
navigate to new page without reloading
link component works as a tag SPA
client side no network call server side
use effect takes two argument
one is callback function and second is optionsl argument(depency arrays)
function based component is nothing but javascript function that returns jsx
class bases component is nothing but the class which has method render which returns jsx
what is jsx?
super why we add in class based component
loading class based component means creating instance of class
whenever we create instance of class constructor gets called
this.state is object and we add state variable inside it
when the class loads contructor gets called and then render is called
parent child
parent constructor parent render
child constructor child render child didmount parent didmount
component did mount to make api call: load UI then API call and render to not to wait for UI reacts wants to quickly render it then make api call and get the data render

project.wojtechmaj.pl lifecycle hook
1.parent constructor
2.parent render
3.first child constructor
4.first child render
5.second child constructor
6.second child render
7.first child component did mount
8.second child component did mount
9.parent component did mount


why this is like this?
react is batching render phase for multiple childeren because when the commit phase starts react update the dom and dom manipulay-tion is constly it takes lot of time
render phase is fast as it is batches where only diff algo i.e virtual dom works
dom updation in commit phase
1.constructor 
2.render with dummy state
3.component did mount
4.setstate
5.render with actual data
6.component did update
7.component will unmount - when component disappear from page

after first render component did mount called and after that each render component did update gets called
componentwillunmount -  lots of stuf we need to clear while leaving the page
return function in useeffect to write clean up code
custom hook 
single responsibility principle reusable maintainable testable
hooks are utility functions
app chunking/code spliting/dynamic bundling/lazyloading/ondemand/dynamic import
saas scss styled component
tailwind css
material up  bootstrape chakra ui ant design
tailwind css gives class name
pros:
no move between files
lot of css have to write classed code looks ugly
it is light weight
all developer give similar classes
higher order component is a function that takes a component and return the component they are pure function not hchanging behaviour
controllled and uncontrolled components
lifting the state up
ui layer data layer ui layer powered by data layer

absulte span p div justify flex padding margin
controlled and uncontrolled components lifting state up
props drilling
react context- createcontext usecontext
in class based component we need to add <conext.consumer>{data=>console.log(data})
context is global space i can provide to app or small portion
userconect in class base takes call back function
global modfiication of userconet we can pass provider and value
redux state managment library is external library
small application use conetxt
redux is not mandatory
heavry read write large sclae operations
zustand is replacement of redux

use of redux
handling data i.e state of operation large scale operations
easier to debug
when u call add button it distacpatches the action which calls the function(reducer) tht modify the slice of redux store -- write
use selector to read from slice(subscribing to the store)
if u dont subscribe to right portion of store it will be big performance loss
reducers reducer
immer
current state
rtk says u can either mutate the state or return new state
devtool redux
rtk query
middleware thunks
developer can do three types of testing
1.unit testing
2.integration testing
3.end to end testing
react testing library build on dom testing librarby nd it uses jest
npx jest init
jsdom gives u like browser to test
__tests__
dunder test
install babel preset


pb
try to do things unique way
u have to be honest
cnceinous and international effot unique honest








*** NETFlix
npx create-react-app name of project
it uses webpack as bundler
we can can also use vite
